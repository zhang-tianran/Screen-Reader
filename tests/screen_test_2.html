			<h1>All About Tapirs</h1>
			<p>Tapirs describe a family of mammals with iconic looking snouts.  They are odd-toed ungulates, like horses and rhinos, which means that they have hooves but also an odd number of toes. There are 4 extant species of tapirs: Barid's, South American, Mountain, and Malayan.</p>
